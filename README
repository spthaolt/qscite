QSciTE - a programmer's editor powered by Qt 4 and Scintilla

BUILDING
qmake handles most of the heavy lifting. 'qmake qscite-debug.pro' or
'qmake qscite-release.pro' with a Qt 4 qmake and your favorite makespec will
most likely do the right thing.

PLATFORM NOTES
#TODO: other platforms
Mac OS X
The project file assumes that QScintilla has been installed as a framework.
To do this, pass 'CONFIG += framework' to qmake when building QScintilla.
The default OS X bundle is inadequate. After building, 
'cp -R macx-bundle-contents/* QSciTE.app/Contents/' will update it.
