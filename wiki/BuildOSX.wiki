#summary Notes for building QSciTE on Mac OS X
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Dependencies =

== Qt 4 ==

My installed version of Qt is 4.3.2. Qt 4.2 may be usable, but it has not been tested. Any Qt older than 4.2 is almost guaranteed not to work.

== QScintilla ==

We use the 20080209 snapshot of QScintilla 2, currently available from http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/Downloads/Snapshots/QScintilla2/.

The QSciTE project file assumes that QScintilla has been built as a framework on OS X. QScintilla does not build a framework by default; add 'CONFIG+=framework' to the appropriate project file or to the qmake command line.

= Idiosyncrasies =

On my installation of Qt, building with '-spec macx-g++' adds 'debug' to the project configuration several times. To build a release version, use 'CONFIG-=debug' on the command line or just before the debug{} block in the project file.
